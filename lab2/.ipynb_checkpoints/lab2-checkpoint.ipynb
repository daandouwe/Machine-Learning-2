    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, we will implement the sum-product and max-sum algorithms for factor graphs over discrete variables. The relevant theory is covered in chapter 8 of Bishop's PRML book, in particular section 8.4. Read this chapter carefuly before continuing!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first implement sum-product and max-sum and apply it to a simple poly-tree structured factor graph for medical diagnosis. Then, we will implement a loopy version of the algorithms and use it for image denoising.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we recommended you stick to numpy ndarrays (constructed with np.array, np.zeros, np.ones, etc.) as opposed to numpy matrices, because arrays can store n-dimensional arrays whereas matrices only work for 2d arrays. We need n-dimensional arrays in order to store conditional distributions with more than 1 conditioning variable. If you want to perform matrix multiplication on arrays, use the np.dot function; all infix operators including *, +, -, work element-wise on arrays."

    "Write a method `send_sp_msg(self, other)` for the Factor class, that checks if all the information required to pass a message to Variable `other` is present, computes the message and sends it to `other`. \"Sending\" here simply means calling the `receive_msg` function of the receiving node (we will implement this later). The message itself should be represented as a numpy array (np.array) whose length is equal to the number of states of the variable.\n",

    "An elegant and efficient solution can be obtained using the n-way outer product of vectors. This product takes n vectors $\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(n)}$ and computes a $n$-dimensional tensor (ndarray) whose element $i_0,i_1,...,i_n$ is given by $\\prod_j \\mathbf{x}^{(j)}_{i_j}$. In python, this is realized as `np.multiply.reduce(np.ix_(*vectors))` for a python list `vectors` of 1D numpy arrays. Try to figure out how this statement works -- it contains some useful functional programming techniques. Another function that you may find useful in computing the message is `np.tensordot`."

    "Write a function `sum_product(node_list)` that runs the sum-product message passing algorithm on a tree-structured factor graph with given nodes. The input parameter `node_list` is a list of all Node instances in the graph, which is assumed to be ordered correctly. That is, the list starts with a leaf node, which can always send a message. Subsequent nodes in `node_list` should be capable of sending a message when the pending messages of preceding nodes in the list have been sent. The sum-product algorithm then proceeds by passing over the list from beginning to end, sending all pending messages at the nodes it encounters. Then, in reverse order, the algorithm traverses the list again and again sends all pending messages at each node as it is encountered. For this to work, you must initialize pending messages for all the leaf nodes, e.g. `influenza_prior.pending.add(influenza)`, where `influenza_prior` is a Factor node corresponding the the prior, `influenza` is a Variable node and the only connection of `influenza_prior` goes to `influenza`.\n",
